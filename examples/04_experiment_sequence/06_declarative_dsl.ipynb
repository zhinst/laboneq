    "# Declarative DSL Style\n",
    "\n",
    "LabOne Q's domain-specific language (DSL) is the immediate user interface to define experiments, calibrations and everything else LabOne Q specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly when you define experiments, you can choose between the imperative and the declarative DSL style. Each one might have some distinct advantages useful for specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Use the declarative DSL style to build a Ramsey experiment\n",
    "- How to manipulate sections to change the experiment's behavior without having to redefine the entire experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, it might help you to think of your experiment as a tree: Often, its trunk is a real-time acquisition loop, which governs the averaging. It's branches are sections, which contain either more sections or pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Imperative Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our example notebooks use the imperative DSL style to define experiments. The imperative style makes extensive use of Python's `with` statements, and the structure of the code represents the structure of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Declarative Style\n",
    "\n",
    "In the declarative DSL style, you define the constituent elements (sweeps, sections) of your experiments, and then \"declare\" how they interact with each other."
