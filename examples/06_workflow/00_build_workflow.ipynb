    "\n",
    "* Only functions marked as tasks should be called within a workflow definition\n",
    "* Using Python statements (`if`, `else`, `for`, `return` etc.) should not be used in the Workflow, however they can be used freely in tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for above limitations is to ensure that a graph of dependencies between tasks\n",
    "can be created and the `Workflow` can then fully control the execution flow.\n",

    "#### Workflow references\n",
    "\n",
    "While the workflow is being constructed, the actual variables (workflow inputs, task outputs) are replaced\n",
