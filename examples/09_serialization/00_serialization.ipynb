    "# New serializers in LabOne Q\n",
    "\n",
    "The new LabOne Q serialization framework allows for more flexibility in the serialization process. It has a versioning scheme that keeps track of changes in the LabOne Q data structures and ensures backwards compatibility between different versions of LabOne Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new serialization framework also makes it possible to serialize and deserialize objects that are not part of the standard LabOne Q library. Such features are useful, for example, when users want to implement new [quantum elements](https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/core/functionality_and_concepts/04_quantum_processing_unit/tutorials/01_quantum_elements.html) or [quantum operations](https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/core/functionality_and_concepts/04_quantum_processing_unit/tutorials/00_quantum_operations.html) classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the structure of the object changes, new versions of the serialization can be added to the serializer. The serializer can then handle the different versions of the objects automatically and hence maintain the backwards compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently supported objects for serialization are:\n",
    "* Python built-in data types\n",
    "* Numpy arrays\n",
    "* QPU\n",
    "* QuantumParameters\n",
    "* QuantumElement\n",
