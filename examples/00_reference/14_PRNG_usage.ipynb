    "## General notes on PRNG setup and sampling \n",
    "\n",
    "In LabOne Q, usage of the PRNG can be invoked via the `setup_prng()`, `prng_loop()` commands. An experiment using the PRNG roughly has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with prng_setup(seed=..., range=...) as prng:  # 1.\n",
    "    with prng_loop(prng=prng, count=...) as prng_sample:  # 2.\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        with match(prng_sample=prng_sample):  # 3.\n",
    "            with case(0):\n",
    "                play(...)\n",
    "            with case(1):\n",
    "                play(...)\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The important steps here:\n",
    "1. We _seed_ the PRNG and specify its range with `prng_setup()`. We can now draw random numbers from the PRNG, in the range of 0 to `range - 1`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The seed and range are valid within the scope of the `prng_setup()` block. As there is only a single PRNG available per sequencer, PRNG setups cannot be nested, but we are free to reseed the PRNG again later.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. The actual sampling of the random numbers happens in `prng_loop()`. This block marks a section that will be executed `count` times, with a new random number drawn each time. The result of the context manager (i.e. the right-hand side of `as`, here `prng_sample`) provides us with a handle to those random numbers.\n",
    " \n",
    "   It may be helpful to think of `prng_sample` as similar to a sweep parameter. Like a sweep parameter, it is representative of the values that the the variable will take during the iterations of the loop. The PRNG sample is also a convenient way to access a simulation of the PRNG values, see below.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. We use the PRNG sample to branch into one of multiple options. We do this with a `match` block, and providing one `case` for each value the PRNG might emit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note on PRNG loop iteration length\n",
    "\n",
    "If the body of the PRNG loop between subsequent calls to `get_sample()` is too short, the waveform play-back may contain gaps as the sequencer may become unable to issue new waveforms fast enough. \n",
    "We recommend to always make the body of the PRNG loop at least 64 samples long. \n"
