    "A common use case for HDAWG instruments is to use its baseband outputs individually (i.e. without combining pairs into IQ signals).\n",
    "It is possbile to use complex-valued pulse envelopes on such signals, however there is a nuance related to their modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If software modulation is used, it fully allows programming complex-valued baseband signals on RF signal lines. LabOneQ modulates the complex-valued pulse envelope with a complex oscillator, as if modulating an IQ signal. The physical output is the real part of the modulation result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is different when hardware modulation is used - there is only a single hardware oscillator, hence it cannot modulate the signal in its full complex form. Thus, the imaginary part of the pulse envolpe is ignored, and a warning is logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, in use cases where baseband RF signals are used in conjuction with complex-valued pulse envelopes, you should use software modulation.\n",
    "In use cases where baseband RF signals are used with real-valued pulse envelopes, both modulation modes can be used at your convenience.\n",
