    "# Declarative DSL Style\n",
    "\n",
    "LabOne Q's domain-specific language (DSL) is the immediate user interface to define experiments, calibrations and everything else LabOne Q specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly when you define experiments, you can choose between the imperative, the context-based, and the declarative DSL style. Each one might have some distinct advantages useful for specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Use the declarative DSL style to build a Ramsey experiment\n",
    "- How to manipulate sections to change the experiment's behavior without having to redefine the entire experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, it might help you to think of your experiment as a tree: Often, its trunk is a real-time acquisition loop, which governs the averaging. It's branches are sections, which contain either more sections or pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Imperative Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our example notebooks use the imperative DSL style to define experiments. The imperative style makes extensive use of Python's `with` statements, and the structure of the code represents the structure of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Context-Based Style\n",
    "\n",
    "The context-based style takes the imperative style one step further and adds an experiment context that allows one to write `play(...)` rather than `exp.play(...)`. Sections and operations are automatically\n",
    "added to the experiment and section being constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Declarative Style\n",
    "\n",
    "In the declarative DSL style, you define the constituent elements (sweeps, sections) of your experiments, and then \"declare\" how they interact with each other."
