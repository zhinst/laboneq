    "\n",
    "    These options are used to set parameters for tasks in the workflow. An example of `TaskOptions` class would be one which contains options for setting how experiments should run. For example, the number of experiment shots `counts`, the averaging mode `averaging_mode`, the acquisition type `acquisition_type` and so on. \n",

    "\n",
    "    These options are used to set parameters for the workflow. These include the settings for operating the workflow, such as `logstore` which specifies the protocol for storing a collection of records of workflow execution.\n",
    "    In addition, `WorkflowOptions` contain options for the constituent tasks and sub-workflow. Users typically do not have to manually set these options as they are automatically generated by the workflow.\n",
