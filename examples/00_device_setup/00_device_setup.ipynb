    "# Device Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components and Purpose\n",
    "The device setup class in LabOne Q allows you to represent all information on the hardware of your experimental setup.\n",
    "This includes\n",
    "* Instruments i.e. Zurich Instruments' control electronics including\n",
    "  * Serial numbers of the instruments\n",
    "  * User-defined ids to reference each instrument\n",
    "  * Upgradable [device options](https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/core/functionality_and_concepts/00_device_setup/concepts/02_instrument_options.html)\n",
    "  * Connections between instruments for signal synchronization (e.g. ZSync)\n",
    "* Definition of signal lines, qubits, etc.\n",
    "  * Signal types\n",
    "  * Logical signal lines\n",
    "  * Physical ports\n",
    "  * Other connection options\n",
    "* (Optimal) Information on LabOne data server information used to connect to the instruments\n",
    "  * User-defined id to reference the data server\n",
    "  * IP address\n",
    "  * Port numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional electronics may be part of the setup, such as DC sources or radio-frequency signal generators. These are not included in the descriptor since LabOne Q does not provide drivers for these instruments. Nevertheless, LabOne Q provides an interface to control such instruments in the normal workflow via user-defined callback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Scenarios and Learning Goals\n",
    "When using LabOne Q to run experiments, one will typically define a `DeviceSetup` instance once in the very beginning and later only load and modify such objects when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections of this tutorial will guide you through the technical details of the device setup class and demonstrate how to define and use its components.\n",
    "You will find these concepts likely useful when...\n",
    "* creating `DeviceSetup` objects whose components you need to alter often within your notebook\n",
    "* or when defining large device setups programmatically at scale \n",
    "\n",
    "After you gained some familiarity with the device setup class itself we will learn the details of the device descriptor.\n",
    "The device descriptor is a string-based input format the you can use to...\n",
    "* load and/or store an initial definition of a `DeviceSetup` object (without any calibration settings applied)\n",
    "* or initialize device setups of typically small to medium scale\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will examine examples of different device setups and finally take a look at some device setup templates that can be loaded and used for as starting point and for prototyping."
