        repetition_time:
            The length that any single program is padded to.
        batch_execution_mode:
            The execution mode for the sequence of programs. Can be any of the following:

            - "nt": The individual programs are dispatched by software.
            - "pipeline": The individual programs are dispatched by the sequence pipeliner.
            - "rt": All the programs are combined into a single real-time program.

            "rt" offers the fastest execution, but is limited by device memory.
            In comparison, "pipeline" introduces non-deterministic delays between
            programs of up to a few 100 microseconds. "nt" is the slowest.
        add_reset:
            If `True`, an active reset operation is added to the beginning of each program.
        add_measurement:
            If `True`, add measurement at the end for all qubits used.
        add_measurement_handle:
            A template for the handles of measurements added when `add_measurement` is true.
            Defaults to `{qubit.uid}/result`.

        pipeline_chunk_count:
            The number of pipeline chunks to divide the experiment into.
