            The quantum processing unit to create the experiment for.
        program:
            OpenQASM program.
        qubit_map:
            A map from OpenQASM qubit names to LabOne Q DSL Qubit objects.
            The values can either be a single qubit or a list of qubits in case of an qubit register.
        inputs:
            Inputs to the program.
        externs:
            A mapping for program extern definitions.

            Externs may be either functions (Python `callable`s) or
            ports on qubit signals.
        options:
            Optional settings for the LabOne Q Experiment.

            Default: [SingleProgramOptions]()

            Accepts also a dictionary with following items:

            **count**:
                The number of acquire iterations.

            **acquisition_mode**:
                The mode of how to average the acquired data.

            **acquisition_type**:
                The type of acquisition to perform.
                The acquisition type may also be specified within the
                OpenQASM program using `pragma zi.acqusition_type raw`,
                for example.
                If an acquisition type is passed here, it overrides
                any value set by a pragma.
                If the acquisition type is not specified, it defaults
                to [enums.AcquisitionType.INTEGRATION]().

            **reset_oscillator_phase**:
                When true, reset all oscillators at the start of every
                acquisition loop iteration.

    Returns:
        A LabOne Q Experiment.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Supplied qubit(s) does not exists in the QPU.
        OpenQasmException: The program cannot be transpiled.

            Accepts also a dictionary with the following items:

            **count**:
                The number of acquire iterations.

            **acquisition_mode**:
                The mode of how to average the acquired data.

            **acquisition_type**:
                The type of acquisition to perform.
                The acquisition type may also be specified within the

            **reset_oscillator_phase**:
                When true, reset all oscillators at the start of every
                acquisition loop iteration.

            **repetition_time**:
                The minimum duration of any single program.
                If `None`, the default, each program runs for its own duration.
                If not `None`, any program shorter than `repetition_time` is padded
                to reach the given length. Programs longer than `repetition_time`
                will keep their longer length.
                The length of each program excludes the length of any resets or
                measurements added using `add_reset` or `add_measurement`.

            **batch_execution_mode**:
                The execution mode for the sequence of programs. Can be any of the following.

            * `nt`: The individual programs are dispatched by software.
            * `pipeline`: The individual programs are dispatched by the sequence pipeliner.
            * `rt`: All the programs are combined into a single real-time program.

            `rt` offers the fastest execution, but is limited by device memory.
            In comparison, `pipeline` introduces non-deterministic delays between
            programs of up to a few 100 microseconds. `nt` is the slowest.

            **do_reset**:
                If `True`, an active reset operation is added to the beginning of each program.

            Note: Requires `reset(qubit)` operation to be defined for each qubit.

            **add_measurement**:
                If `True`, add measurement at the end of each program for all qubits used.
                The measurement results for each qubit are stored in a handle named
                `'meas{qasm_qubit_name}'` where `qasm_qubit_name` is the key specified for the
                qubit in the `qubit_map` parameter.

            Note: Requires `measure(qubit, handle: str)` operation to be defined for each qubit.

            **pipeline_chunk_count**:
                The number of pipeline chunks to divide the experiment into.

    Returns:
        A LabOne Q Experiment.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Supplied qubit(s) does not exists in the QPU.
        OpenQasmException: The program cannot be transpiled.
