class IntervalSchedule:
    """Base class of a scheduled interval.

    Internally, the schedule is represented as a tree. Nodes of the tree are instances
    of :`~.IntervalSchedule`. An `IntervalSchedule` is an abstraction of a 'box' that
    occupies a certain number of signals (`IntervalSchedule.signals`) for a specific
    duration (`IntervalSchedule.length`). In particular, an `IntervalSchedule` may
    represent a single pulse, or a section (with possible subsections). Loops also are
    similarly represented as nested schedules.

    Notably, each `IntervalSchedule` does initially not store its start time. Instead,
    the parent stores the start times of its children in `self.children_start`. These
    time stamps are relative to the start time of the parent itself, which allows us to
    move an entire sub-schedule (including its children) in time without touching any of
    its attributes. This 'shifting' in time is valid as long as the start time of a sub-
    schedule, in absolute terms, remains on the grid required by the sub-schedule
    (`IntervalSchedule.grid`). For example, if a section must be aligned to the _system
    grid_ of 4 ns, then we are free to move. One exception are match sections, which
    need a minimal distance to their acquire event; `_calculate_timing` thus has a
    parameter `start_may_change` to express that the given start time may not be final.

    Gradually, as right-alignments and RepetitionMode.AUTO timings are resolved,
    intervals are notified about the fact that their absolute start position (after the
    trigger) is resolved and thus can, for example, create constraints for acquire/match
    pairs. The absolute time (in case of loops for the first iteration) is stored in
    `absolute_time`. While this property is somewhat redundant, it also serves as a flag
    to indicate that the timing for this subtree has already be determined and thus
    allows for an early stop.
