        Execute a measurement.

        Unifies the optional playback of a measurement pulse, the acquisition of the return signal

        For pulsed spectroscopy, set `integration_length` and either `measure_pulse` or `measure_pulse_length`.

        For CW spectroscopy, set only `integration_length` and do not specify the measure signal.

        For multistate discrimination, use lists of equal length for integration_kernel and integration_kernel_parameters.

                See below for details.
            on_system_grid:
                If True, the section boundaries are always rounded to the
                system grid, even if the signals would allow for tighter alignment.

        The individual trigger (a.k.a marker) ports on the device are addressed via the
        experiment signal that is mapped to the corresponding analog port.
        For playing trigger pulses, pass a dictionary via the `trigger` argument. The
        keys of the dictionary must be an ID of an
        [ExperimentSignal][laboneq.dsl.experiment.experiment_signal.ExperimentSignal].
        Each value is another `dict` of the form:

        ``` py
            {"state": value}
        ```

        `value` is a bit field that enables the individual trigger signals (on the
        devices that feature more than a single one).

        ``` py
            {"state": 1}  # raise trigger signal 1
            {"state": 0b10}  # raise trigger signal 2 (on supported devices)
            {"state": 0b11}  # raise both trigger signals
        ```

        As a more complete example, to fire a trigger pulse on the first port associated
        with signal `"drive_line"`, call:

        ``` py
            with exp.section(..., trigger={"drive_line": {"state": 0b01}}):
                ...
        ```

        When trigger signals on the same signal are issued in nested sections, the values
        are ORed.
