# DSL v3 - Executable Prototype

## Purpose
The purpose of this prototype implementation is to show-case the aspects of the new DSL v3 approach by implementing a Ramsey experiment.

The specification of the DSL v3 can be found https://wiki.zhinst.com/wiki/x/sIVOCQ[here].

Further, this prototype is intended to be used internally only for developing the final version of DSL v3.


## Disclaimer

This prototype is for internal use only. It is neither in production ready state nor intended to be used with external testers or customers.

The code produces results for a Ramsey experiment which are not validated. Other use cases are not tested with this version of the prototype.

The code quality as well as the documentation and error handling is not in production ready state. There needs to be specific development effort to bring this prototype into production ready quality. This holds valid until the notion of a prototype is removed from this source code.

## Install
The source code of this prototype is located in a seperate top level folder called `dsl` in the https://gitlab.zhinst.com/qccs/qccs-main/[QCCS repository].

This forlder is set up as a Python package, but there is no deployment of a corresponding deliverable in the form of a pip package. Therefore, installation of this package needs to be done manually and on source level.

TIP: You may want to be in a virtual Python environment for the next steps.

In the repository root, call:
```
# Dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# DSLv3
pip install -e dsl
```

Make sure to also install the other required QCCS packages `qccs-api`, `laboneq.controller` and `qccs-compiler-binary`.

 * Either do it with the official install instructions from deployed packages _[recommended]_
 * or install them from the source repo as well as follows:

```
# API
pip install -e api

# Controller
pip install -e controller

# Compiler Binaries
cd compiler
make build-debug
pip install -e build_debug/compiler-binary
cd ..
```

## Execute
The show-case Ramsey experiment can be executed in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook:
