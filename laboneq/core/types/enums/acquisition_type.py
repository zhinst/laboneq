    The following acquisition types supported:
        INTEGRATION:
            Returns acquired signal after demodulation and integration, using weighting vectors (kernel) up to 4096 points.

        SPECTROSCOPY:
            Returns acquired signal after demodulation and integration, using oscillator frequency (not limited to 4096 points).

        DISCRIMINATION:
            Returns the list of qubit states determined from demodulated and integrated signal (not implemented).

        DEMODULATION:
            Reserved, not implemented.

        RAW:
            Returns raw data after ADC up to 4096 samples. Only a single raw acquire event within an averaging loop per experiment is allowed.
