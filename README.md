# LabOne Q

[LabOne Q](https://www.zhinst.com/quantum-computing-systems/labone-q) is Zurich
Instrument’s software framework to accelerate progress in quantum computing. Its
Python-based, high-level programming interface enables users to concentrate on
intuitive, efficient experiment design, while automatically accounting for their
instrumentation details and maximizing useful computation time. Tight system
integration between software and hardware ensures a seamless user experience
from setups with a single qubit to those with 100 and more.
