= LabOne Q

LabOne Q is Zurich Instrument's software framework to accelerate progress in quantum computing. Its Python-based, high-level programming interface enables users to concentrate on intuitive, efficient experiment design, while automatically accounting for their instrumentation details and maximizing useful computation time. Tight system integration between software and hardware ensures a seamless user experience from setups with a single qubit to those with 100 and more.

== Requirements

IMPORTANT: This software requires Python 3.7 or higher.
We assume that `pip3` and `python3` uses a corresponding python version.

TIP: To ease the maintenance of multiple installations,
we recommended to use Python environments through e.g. **venv**, **pipenv** or **conda**.

== Installation

The following commands will make LabOne Q available in your current environment.

    pip3 install --upgrade laboneq
